# Design for social change
**Prof. Jay Menon and Seema Krishnakumar**

The repository puts together the student work from **Design for social change** course for 3rd year UG Communication Design conducted at DJ Academy of Design, Coimbatore from 2014 - 18. 

The objective of the course was to trigger design intervention in social issues / social dilemmas to bring awareness to a group of people. The course intended direct action from students in community through planned communication and events. It also had to evaluate the impact of their intervention. 

The intervention is a culmination of using all their skills and mediums they learned so far in earlier semesters. They were encouraged to use graphics, data, animation/ video, participatory techniques to get the maximum results. 

The 4 week module is a process oriented course that takes through the concept - storyboard - execution - presentation stages.
